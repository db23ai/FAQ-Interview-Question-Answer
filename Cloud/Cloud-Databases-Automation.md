### 1. üåç What experience do you have with cloud-based databases, such as AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL?

**Answer:**

I‚Äôve managed various cloud-based databases including:

- **AWS RDS (Oracle, PostgreSQL)**: Set up multi-AZ deployments, configured enhanced monitoring, and automated snapshots.
- **Google Cloud SQL**: Used for quick provisioning in Dev/Test environments.
- **Azure SQL**: Managed geo-replication and threat detection.

I‚Äôm familiar with scaling options, automated backups, IAM roles, and monitoring via CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.

### 2. ü§ñ How do you automate database backups, monitoring, and maintenance?

**Answer:**

- **Backups**: Scheduled using cron jobs, `pgBackRest`, `RMAN`, or native cloud snapshot mechanisms.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Prometheus + Grafana or cloud-native tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor).
- **Maintenance**: Automated index rebuilds, statistics updates using scripts or jobs (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Automation).

### 3. üì¶ What is your experience with database as a service (DBaaS)? How do you manage these services?

**Answer:**

I‚Äôve worked extensively with DBaaS offerings:

- Provisioning and configuring RDS, Azure SQL DB, and MongoDB Atlas.
- Managing backups, failover, read replicas via console or CLI.
- Ensuring compliance via parameter groups, encryption, and auditing.
- Cost optimization using instance scheduling and rightsizing.

DBaaS reduces overhead but requires vigilance in monitoring, configuration, and security best practices.
