# Oracle Autonomous Database

## What is the Oracle Autonomous Database?

Oracle Autonomous Database is the world’s first autonomous data management system in the cloud. It delivers automated patching, upgrades, and tuning—including performing all routine database maintenance tasks while the system is running—without human intervention. This self-managing, self-securing, and self-repairing database helps to eliminate manual database management and human errors.

The Oracle Autonomous Database is fully elastic: You simply specify the number of ECPUs and storage capacity in GBs or TBs. At any time, you may scale up or down the ECPUs or storage capacity.

### Types of Workloads Supported
Autonomous Database supports four main types of workload:
1. **Transaction Processing and Mixed Workloads**
2. **Analytics and Data Warehousing**
3. **Transactions and Analytics on JSON Data**
4. **APEX Application Development**

## Difference Between Dedicated and Serverless Deployments

### Serverless
With this option, you provision and manage only the Autonomous Database. Oracle deploys and manages all the underlying infrastructure. Oracle autonomously operates all aspects of the database lifecycle, from database placement to backup and updates.

### Dedicated
This option offers a private cloud in the public cloud with a completely dedicated compute, storage, network, and database service for only a single tenant. It also provides a multitenant database architecture, allowing you to manage multiple Autonomous Databases within a single system. Autonomous Database Dedicated is available in customer data centers with Exadata Cloud at Customer.
