# ðŸ“¦ Oracle Autonomous Database Dedicated


## ðŸ“Œ 1. What is Autonomous Database Dedicated (ADB-D)?
**Autonomous Database Dedicated (ADB-D)** is a deployment option that allows customers to provision Oracle Autonomous Databases on their own dedicated **Exadata Cloud Infrastructure**. 

ADB-D offers full customization over operational policies and provides software and hardware isolation for enhanced performance and security governance. It is well-suited for customers who need:
- Full control over operational policies
- Self-service capabilities for their database cloud
- Deployment within their own dedicated cloud infrastructure

This solution is ideal for organizations that require high-performance, security, and governance at scale, as well as those who prefer managing their database lifecycle within a controlled environment. ADB-D is available both in Oracle Cloud and via **Exadata Cloud@Customer**, where it is deployed in the customer's data center.

- Quick database provisioning with scalable compute and storage.
- No minimum commitment required.
- Best suited for users who prefer the simplest configuration and want Oracle to manage all operational aspects.

### **Dedicated (ADB-D)**:
- Customers have exclusive access to **dedicated Exadata Cloud Infrastructure**.
- No shared processor, memory, network, or storage resources.
- Ideal for customers who need full control over their database infrastructure and policies, including:
  - Software update schedules
  - Versioning
  - Availability policies
- **Available in Oracle Cloud and Exadata Cloud@Customer**.
- Best for organizations with specific operational needs or security policies that require customization.
