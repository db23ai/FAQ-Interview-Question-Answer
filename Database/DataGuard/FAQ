## ðŸ”¹ Basic Level

### 1. What is Oracle Data Guard?
Oracle Data Guard is a disaster recovery and high availability solution that maintains standby copies (physical or logical) of a production database. It ensures data integrity and enables failover if the primary database fails.

---

### 2. What are the components of Oracle Data Guard?
- **Primary Database**
- **Standby Database** (Physical, Logical, Snapshot, or Far Sync)
- **Redo Transport Services**
- **Log Apply Services**
- **Data Guard Broker** (optional management tool)

---

### 3. Difference: Physical vs Logical Standby

| Feature | Physical Standby | Logical Standby |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Structure | Exact replica | Can differ structurally |
| Apply Method | Redo Apply | SQL Apply |
| Usage | Best for DR | Used for reporting/BI |
| Performance | Higher | Lower |

---

### 4. What are the Data Guard Protection Modes?
- **Maximum Protection** â€“ Zero data loss, commit only when standby confirms.
- **Maximum Availability** â€“ Zero loss unless standby unavailable.
- **Maximum Performance** â€“ Minimal impact, allows potential data loss.

### 5. How to configure Data Guard?
1. Setup TNS and listener
2. Enable `FORCE LOGGING` on primary
3. Create standby control file
4. Duplicate using RMAN
5. Configure log shipping and parameters:
   - `LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n`
   - `FAL_SERVER`
   - `FAL_CLIENT`

## ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level

### 6. What is a Far Sync Instance?
A Far Sync instance receives redo from the primary and forwards it to standbys. It has no datafiles or apply servicesâ€”just used for transport.

---

### 7. Purpose of `FAL_SERVER` and `FAL_CLIENT`?
- `FAL_SERVER` â€“ Location to fetch missing logs (usually primary).
- `FAL_CLIENT` â€“ Identity of the requesting database (usually standby).

---

### 8. Monitoring Data Guard
```sql
-- Database role
SELECT DATABASE_ROLE FROM V$DATABASE;

-- Managed recovery processes
SELECT PROCESS, STATUS FROM V$MANAGED_STANDBY;

-- Archive destination errors
SELECT DEST_ID, ERROR FROM V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS;
