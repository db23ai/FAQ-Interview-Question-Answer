# üß† Behavioral Database Interview Q&A

These examples demonstrate how to articulate technical experience, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure in database-related roles.

### 1. üí• Tell me about a time when you had to troubleshoot a critical database issue under pressure. What steps did you take to resolve the issue?

**Answer:**

During a peak business hour, our production Oracle RAC database experienced significant locking and session hangs. I quickly:

- Checked **Active Session History (ASH)** and **AWR reports** for blocking sessions.
- Identified a poorly optimized ad-hoc query that caused a **full table lock**.
- Terminated the offending session and advised the dev team on optimizing the query with proper indexing.
- Applied a hotfix and scheduled a post-mortem to prevent recurrence.

**Result:** Downtime was minimized to under 10 minutes, and we implemented query governance policies afterward.

### 2. üöÄ Describe a time when you improved the performance of a database. What changes did you make, and what were the results?

**Answer:**

One of our PostgreSQL databases was experiencing slow reports. I:

- Analyzed slow queries using **pg_stat_statements** and **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**.
- Added missing indexes on join columns.
- Partitioned a large table by date.
- Tuned memory parameters like `work_mem` and `shared_buffers`.

**Result:** Report generation time reduced from 2 minutes to under 10 seconds.

### 3. ü§ù Tell me about a situation where you had to collaborate with a development team to resolve a database issue.

**Answer:**

A release introduced a feature that caused massive **temp tablespace usage**. I:

- Worked with devs to review the query logic.
- Suggested breaking down large CTEs into intermediate temp tables.
- Educated them on PL/SQL bulk operations to avoid row-by-row processing.

**Result:** Temp usage dropped by 80%, and the devs gained a better understanding of database best practices.

### 4. üß© How do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple urgent database issues?

**Answer:**

I use a **triage approach**:

1. Assess business impact and SLAs.
2. Stabilize production-impacting issues first.
3. Delegate or defer non-critical items.
4. Communicate status updates clearly to stakeholders.

I also keep an updated **incident management checklist** to ensure nothing gets missed.

### 5. ‚è≥ How do you handle situations where you are unable to solve a problem right away?

**Answer:**

I follow this approach:

- **Document findings** as I go.
- **Escalate early** if needed while continuing parallel analysis.
- Use internal knowledge bases and external communities (MOS, Stack Overflow).
- Keep stakeholders informed and maintain logs for transparency.

### 6. üìö Describe a time when you had to learn a new technology or database tool quickly. How did you manage?

**Answer:**

When our org adopted **MongoDB**, I was tasked with setting up a replica set and backup strategy.

- I took MongoDB University's free online course.
- Built a test cluster in Docker to simulate failures.
- Implemented `mongodump`, `mongorestore`, and replication monitoring with custom scripts.

**Result:** Production setup was deployed smoothly with zero data loss.

### 7. ‚öñÔ∏è Have you ever disagreed with a team member or manager about a technical approach to a database issue? How did you resolve it?

**Answer:**

Yes, during a migration, I disagreed with using an export/import method for a large Oracle DB. I advocated for **Data Pump with transportable tablespaces** for speed.

- Presented benchmark results and downtime estimates.
- Conducted a POC showing my method was 5x faster.
- We aligned on my approach and executed a successful cutover.
